# I believe you've cloned project and pulled from the branch main by now, it's the only branch.

## run 'yarn install' to install project dependencies

### run 'yarn start' in project directory, if nothing is running in localhost:3000, your app will run in that port.

#### pls look out for UI suggested features like navigation tabs, archiving and general response of app components to clicks, hovers. look at the preset ability of components to respond to dynamic data fetched from mock arrays all over the app.

#### app is not as responsive as can be, but i made great effort to achieve a degree of responsiveness on desktop screens
